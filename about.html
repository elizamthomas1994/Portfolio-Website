            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>
                I am a huge fan of rock music and absolutely love to play guitar ðŸŽ¸. In July 2014,
                I interviewed the heavy metal band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Priest" target="_blank" title="Judas Priest's Wikipedia Page">Judas
                    Priest</a> for TeamRock Radio based in the UK.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, in April 2016, I recorded rhythm guitar as a guest musician for UK based rock
                band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amorettes" target="_blank" title="The Amorettes' Wikipedia Page">The Amorettes</a> at 
                <a href="http://www.leedersvale.com/" target="_blank" title="Homepage for Leeders Vale Studios">Leeders Vale Studios</a> on a song named
                <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wySWYY1aH14 target="_blank" title="Listen to the track here!">"Crusader"</a> which
                featured on their album "White Hot Heat". This was distributed worldwide on CD, vinyl and various streaming
                services such as Apple Music, Spotify, Youtube Music, etc. and I have an official credit within
                the album liner notes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, in 2017, I was fortunate enough to join hard rock band <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Star_Riders" target="_blank" title="Black Star Riders' Wikipedia Page">
                    Black Star Riders</a> on-stage in Dublin, Ireland to perform joint lead guitar with them
                on their song "Finest Hour" at the Dublin Academy on the 4th March.

        <div class="education">
        <h3>Education</h3>
            <p> I studied Maths and Spanish at Swansea University in Wales from 2012-2016, and thanks to studying a joint honors
                degree in Spanish, was then able to have the opportunity to live and study abroad in AlcalÃ¡ de Henares,
                on the outskirts of Madrid, between September 2016 and March 2017.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="professional-background">
            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
            <p> After leaving university, I volunteered as a Retail Assistant for the UK based charity <a
                    href="https://qef.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="Homepage for QEF">Queen Elizabeth Foundation</a> between May 2017
                and March 2018
            </p>
            <p> Then, in March 2018, I began to provide customer service for global theme park company <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_Entertainments" target="_blank" title="Merlin's Wikipedia Page">Merlin Entertainments</a> where I
                handled incoming calls, emails and live chats from customers all over the world.

                During my tenure at Merlin I became a member of their Merlin Annual Pass division which meant that on top of handling
                calls and emails, I would also process memberships for Merlin Annual Pass customers, send them out through the post, and 
                engage with customers through the Merlin Annual Pass social media pages on Facebook and Twitter.

        <div class="future-aspirations">
            <h3>Future Aspirations</h3>
                <p> Currently, I am studying coding using online resources such as <a href="http://shecodes.io"
                        target="_blank" title="Hompage for SheCodes">SheCodes</a>, however as of March 2021 I have gained 4 different qualifications through their courses and now
                    my current goal is to further utilise the skills I've obtained in order to transition into the tech industry and hopefully gain a new career 
                    as a Front End Developer so that I can do something I feel truly passionate about.</p>
                <p>
                    On top of this, I am also studying accounting under the <a href="https://www.aat.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="Homepage for AAT">
                    Association of Accounting Technicians</a> qualification to try and gain further experience and help me
                    find employment in more diverse areas.
